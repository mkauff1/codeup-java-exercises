# Inheritance and Polymorphism Bonus

Create an abstract class of Animal

- add the following fields:
    - ```private int numberOfLegs```
    - ```private String prefferedClimate```
    - ```abstract String getAnimalInfo()```: a method that returns a message with number of legs and preferrered climate info
- add getters and setters
- add a constructor that sets all properties

Create a class of Dog, Fish, Cat that extends Animal

- add additional private properties that are unique to each specific animal type and getters and setters for these properties
- overload the getAnimalInfo() to invoke the parent getAnimalInfo() method and return extra info on all the additional properties for the specific animal type
- add a constructor that invokes the parent constructor and sets new properties

Create a class AnimalTester with a method ```public static void displayAnimalDetails(Animal a)``` that prints what is returned from calling the getAnimalInfo() method for a given animal object

- this method should take in any Animal object but test it in the main method
  with instantiated Dog, Fish, Cat objects of type Animal.

Create AnimalApp.java inside package animals (if you haven't already) 
Create an Animal variable and assign it a Dog, pass the appropriate arguments 
Print to the console the return value of that instance's getAnimalInfo() 
Do the same for Cat and Fish

Animals have behaviors which can be inherited - interface time!

    Audible interface allows for animals to make various sounds based on the situation
    Give it at least 2 methods and implement within Animal
